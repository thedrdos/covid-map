# Interactive Geographical Maps of COVID19 Data With Time History

Well sourced COVID19 data with the following key features:

* Interactive geographical heat map of the rate of virus spread
* Granularity (for US, both state and county level)
* Normalization with respect to population (crude measure of societal pressure)

## Maps
* [USA Map Standalone 4-month of data history](plots/map_4mon_standalone.html) (large file, may take a few sec to load)

## Implementation

Code written in Python (and Javascript) to generate interactive html page.
